    ### Privacy preserving Trigger-Action Platform
    This document describes the interface of the REST API that is exposed by PrivTAP backend.
    
    #### Conventions
    All responses are in JSON format and will include an object like this in their body:
    ```typescript
    {
      // Flag indicating if the request has been executed successfully
      "status": boolean,
      // Optional message, this is usually used for error messages
      "message": string,
      // Optional data, this is usually used in successful requests to return the results
      "data": object | array
    }
    ```
    This external structure will not be represented in this document to avoid clutter:
    - for successful responses (status codes 2xx), it is represented the value associated with the *data* field, if present
    - for unsuccessful responses (status codes 4xx/5xx), it is specified a description of what caused the error
    
    Common errors will not be specified in endpoints description, keep in mind that:
    - endpoints that needs authentication can respond with *401 unauthorized*, if the authentication cookie is not valid
    - all endpoints can respond with *5xx internal server error*, if something unexpected happens on the server
    - all endpoints can respons with *400 bad request*, if the required parameters/body fields are not present
    
    Only errors specific to the single endpoints will be specified in this document.
